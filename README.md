 Dear Reader,
 Please follow the instructions in this file, if you want to run the application smoothly

 <strong> Step 1: </strong> Install Golang on your computer. (https://go.dev/doc/install)<br /> 
 <strong>Step 2: </strong> Open up the terminal. Go to the application directory, and make sure you initiate Go modules by "go mod init assignment1" <br /> 
 <strong>Step 3: </strong> Open your favorite code editor and find the folder of this application<br /> 
 <strong>Step 4: </strong> Build 2 Go files "server.go" and "client.go" by typing in the terminal "go build server.go" and then "go build client.go"<br /> 
 <strong>Step 5: </strong> Open 4 different terminal windows. 3 of which will be used as server windows, and 1 as client window  <br /> 
 <strong>Step 6: </strong> In your server terminals, make sure you go to the directory folder of our application. In terminal 1 type "./server 8080". In terminal 2 type "./server 8081". In terminal 3 type "./server 8082". (You can use any other port, if those are taken). <br /> 
 <strong>Step 7: </strong> In the last terminal type "./client localhost:8080 5". Instead of 8080 use any of the ports you initiated, and instead of 5, you can use any number to double it. <br /> 

Done!
